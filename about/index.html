          <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit
            or make a purchase from kitchon.github.io (the “Site”).
          </p>
          <h3>
            PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
            your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
            products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how
            you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
          </p>
          <h3>
            We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
              identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
              http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser
              type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse
              the Site.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain
            information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information
            (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order
            Information.”
          </p>

          <p>
            When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
            Information and Order Information.
          </p>

          <h3>
            HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in
            particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
            generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success
            of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
          </p>
          <h3>
            SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
          </h3>
          <p>
            We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as
            described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the
            Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:
            https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:
            https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to
            respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise
            protect our rights.
          </p>
